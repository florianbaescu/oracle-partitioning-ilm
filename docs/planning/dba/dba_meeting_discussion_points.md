  - [ ] SSD/Flash storage available?
  - [ ] SAS drives available?
  - [ ] SATA/low-cost storage available?

- Are we using ASM, filesystem?
  - [ ] ASM with diskgroups?

|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| HOT | DWH_HOT_DATA | 500 GB | SSD/Flash | Active data |
| HOT | DWH_HOT_IDX | 200 GB | SSD/Flash | Active indexes |
| HOT | DWH_HOT_LOB | 100 GB | SSD/Flash | Active LOBs |
| WARM | DWH_WARM_DATA | 1 TB | SAS | Compressed |
| WARM | DWH_WARM_IDX | 300 GB | SAS | Index compression |
| WARM | DWH_WARM_LOB | 200 GB | SAS | LOB compression |
| COLD | DWH_COLD_DATA | 2 TB | SATA | High compression |
| COLD | DWH_COLD_IDX | 500 GB | SATA | High compression |
| COLD | DWH_COLD_LOB | 300 GB | SATA | High compression |
| ARCHIVE | DWH_ARCHIVE_DATA | 1 TB | SATA/Object | Max compression |
| ARCHIVE | DWH_ARCHIVE_IDX | 200 GB | SATA/Object | Max compression |

**Total Initial Allocation: ~5.5 TB**

**Discussion Points:**
- Are these sizes appropriate for our data volumes?

---

## 2. Licensing & Compliance

### 2.1 Oracle Advanced Compression

**Required for:**
- SECUREFILE LOB compression
- OLTP table compression (WARM tier)
- Query High/Archive High compression (COLD/ARCHIVE tier)
- LOB deduplication

**Questions:**

### 2.2 Compression Strategy by Tier

| Tier | Table Compression | Index Compression | LOB Compression | License Required |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| HOT | None | None or LOW | None | No (Basic) |
| WARM | OLTP | ADVANCED LOW | MEDIUM | Advanced Compression |
| COLD | Query High | ADVANCED HIGH | HIGH | Advanced Compression |
| ARCHIVE | Archive High | ADVANCED HIGH | HIGH + DEDUPE | Advanced Compression |

**Decision Needed:**
- Approve compression types for each tier based on license availability

---

## 3. LOB Management Strategy

### 3.1 Current LOB Usage Assessment

**Critical Questions:**

1. **Which tables contain LOBs (CLOB, BLOB, NCLOB)?**
   - Run assessment query (provided below)
   - Document current LOB storage consumption
   - Identify largest LOB consumers

2. **What is the current total LOB storage consumption?**
   - Total GB of LOB segments
   - Growth rate analysis
   - Percentage of total database size

3. **Are LOBs currently BASICFILE or SECUREFILE?**
   - BASICFILE = legacy, no compression
   - SECUREFILE = modern, compression/dedupe available
   - Migration effort required?

**Assessment Queries to Run Before Meeting:**

**Query 1: Check BASICFILE vs SECUREFILE Status**
```sql
-- Critical: Identify which LOBs are BASICFILE (legacy) vs SECUREFILE
SELECT
    l.owner,
    l.table_name,
    l.column_name,
    CASE
        WHEN l.securefile = 'YES' THEN 'SECUREFILE ✓'
        ELSE 'BASICFILE (Legacy - Needs Migration)'
    END AS lob_type,
    l.compression,
    l.deduplication,
    l.in_row AS storage_in_row,
    ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024/1024, 2) AS size_gb,
    CASE
        WHEN l.securefile = 'NO' AND s.bytes/1024/1024/1024 > 10 THEN 'HIGH PRIORITY MIGRATION'
        WHEN l.securefile = 'NO' AND s.bytes/1024/1024/1024 > 1 THEN 'MEDIUM PRIORITY MIGRATION'
        WHEN l.securefile = 'NO' THEN 'LOW PRIORITY MIGRATION'
        ELSE 'OK (Already SECUREFILE)'
    END AS migration_priority,
    l.tablespace_name
FROM dba_lobs l
LEFT JOIN dba_segments s
    ON l.segment_name = s.segment_name
    AND l.owner = s.owner
WHERE l.owner = 'CMR'
ORDER BY
    CASE WHEN l.securefile = 'NO' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,  -- BASICFILE first
    s.bytes DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**Query 2: Summary Statistics - BASICFILE vs SECUREFILE**
```sql
-- Get totals for discussion
SELECT
    owner,
    CASE
        WHEN securefile = 'YES' THEN 'SECUREFILE'
        ELSE 'BASICFILE (Needs Migration)'
    END AS lob_type,
    COUNT(*) AS lob_count,
    ROUND(SUM(s.bytes)/1024/1024/1024, 2) AS total_gb,
    SUM(CASE WHEN compression != 'NO' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS compressed_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deduplication = 'YES' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dedupe_count
FROM dba_lobs l
LEFT JOIN dba_segments s
    ON l.segment_name = s.segment_name
    AND l.owner = s.owner
WHERE owner = 'CMR'
GROUP BY owner, securefile
ORDER BY securefile;

-- Example output to bring to meeting:
-- OWNER  LOB_TYPE                       LOB_COUNT  TOTAL_GB  COMPRESSED_COUNT  DEDUPE_COUNT
-- CMR    BASICFILE (Needs Migration)    8          45.2      0                 0
-- CMR    SECUREFILE                     15         23.7      10                3
```

**Query 3: Generate Migration DDL for BASICFILE LOBs**
```sql
-- Generate ready-to-execute migration statements
SELECT
    'ALTER TABLE ' || owner || '.' || table_name ||
    ' MOVE ONLINE LOB (' || column_name ||
    ') STORE AS SECUREFILE (TABLESPACE DWH_HOT_LOB COMPRESS MEDIUM);' AS migration_ddl,
    ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024/1024, 2) AS current_size_gb,
    ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024/1024 / 4, 2) AS estimated_compressed_gb,
    '~' || ROUND((1 - (1.0/4)) * 100) || '% savings' AS compression_benefit
FROM dba_lobs l
LEFT JOIN dba_segments s
    ON l.segment_name = s.segment_name
    AND l.owner = s.owner
WHERE l.owner = 'CMR'
  AND l.securefile = 'NO'  -- Only BASICFILE LOBs
ORDER BY s.bytes DESC NULLS LAST;

-- Brings ready-to-execute migration plan to meeting
```

### 3.2 LOB Compression & Deduplication

**Expected Savings:**

   - Buffer cache size for LOB caching?

### 3.3 LOB Migration Strategy

**Questions:**

## 5. Migration Planning

### 5.1 Pilot Table Selection

**Questions:**

- Which tables to migrate first (pilot candidates)?
  - **Criteria:**
    - [ ] Medium size (not too small, not too large)
    - [ ] Clear date partition key
    - [ ] Non-critical to business (low risk)
    - [ ] Representative of larger population

  - **Suggested Candidates:** (to be filled in meeting)
    1. ___________________________
    2. ___________________________
    3. ___________________________

- What is the acceptable downtime per table?

  - [ ] Weekend maintenance window acceptable
  - [ ] Off-hours window acceptable (specify times)

- Rollback procedures and validation criteria?
  - How long to keep original tables?
  - Performance validation criteria?
  - Data integrity checks?

### 5.2 Migration Approach

**Option 1: Big Bang (All tables at once)**

- Cons: Higher risk, longer downtime
- Suitable for: Small table sets, scheduled maintenance

**Option 2: Phased Migration (Table by table)**
- Pros: Lower risk, shorter windows
- Cons: Longer project duration
- Suitable for: Large table sets, zero-downtime requirement

**Option 3: Hybrid (By priority groups)**
- Pros: Balanced approach
- Cons: Requires careful planning
- Suitable for: Most environments

**Decision Needed:**
- Which approach for our environment?
- Pilot phase duration?
- Production rollout schedule?

### 5.3 Migration Timeline (Template)

| Phase | Description | Duration | Target Date | Owner |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Phase 0 | Assessment & Planning | 2 weeks | TBD | Joint |
| Phase 1 | DEV Environment Setup | 1 week | TBD | DBA |
| Phase 2 | Pilot Migration (1-3 tables) | 2 weeks | TBD | Joint |
| Phase 3 | Validation & Tuning | 1 week | TBD | QA/DBA |
| Phase 4 | Production Rollout (Wave 1) | 4 weeks | TBD | Joint |
| Phase 5 | Production Rollout (Wave 2) | 4 weeks | TBD | Joint |
| Phase 6 | Production Rollout (Wave 3) | 4 weeks | TBD | Joint |

## 6. Performance & Monitoring

### 6.1 Performance SLAs

**Questions:**

- What are acceptable query SLAs by data age?
  - HOT data (current): _____ ms/seconds
  - WARM data (1-3 years): _____ ms/seconds
  - COLD data (3+ years): _____ seconds
  - ARCHIVE data (7+ years): _____ seconds/minutes

- How to handle ad-hoc queries against archived data?
  - Separate resource pool?
  - Query timeout limits?
  - User education on query performance?

- Index rebuild strategy during tier transitions?
  - Rebuild immediately after compression?
  - Rebuild during maintenance window?
  - Monitor fragmentation first?

### 6.2 Expected Performance Improvements

**Partition Pruning Benefits:**
- Queries with date predicates scan only relevant partitions
- Example: `WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'` scans only 2024+ partitions
- Expected I/O reduction: 70-95% for time-series queries

**Compression Trade-offs:**
- HOT (no compression): Fastest DML, moderate query speed
- WARM (OLTP compress): Slight DML overhead, good query speed
- COLD (Query High): Read-only, excellent compression, good query speed
- ARCHIVE (Archive High): Read-only, maximum compression, slower queries

**Discussion:**
- Acceptable trade-offs for each tier?
- Performance testing criteria?
- Rollback triggers if performance degrades?
