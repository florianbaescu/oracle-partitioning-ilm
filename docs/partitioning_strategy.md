# Oracle Data Warehouse Partitioning Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines partitioning strategies for Oracle data warehouse tables, focusing on performance optimization and data lifecycle management.

## Partitioning Types

### 1. Range Partitioning
**Best for:** Time-series data, historical data with natural date/time boundaries

**Use Cases:**
- Sales transactions by month/quarter/year
- Log data by date
- Financial data by fiscal period

**Benefits:**
- Easy partition pruning for date range queries
- Simplified data archival and purging
- Optimal for rolling window scenarios

### 2. List Partitioning
**Best for:** Discrete categorical values

**Use Cases:**
- Data by region, country, or state
- Product categories
- Customer segments

**Benefits:**
- Logical data separation
- Query optimization for specific categories
- Easy data maintenance by segment

### 3. Hash Partitioning
**Best for:** Even data distribution, reducing contention

**Use Cases:**
- Tables with no natural partitioning key
- High-volume OLTP tables requiring even distribution
- Reducing I/O bottlenecks

**Benefits:**
- Automatic even distribution
- Improved parallel query performance
- Reduced hot spots

### 4. Composite Partitioning
**Best for:** Complex scenarios requiring multiple partitioning dimensions

**Common Patterns:**
- **Range-Hash:** Partition by date, sub-partition by hash (e.g., sales by month, then by customer_id)
- **Range-List:** Partition by date, sub-partition by region
- **List-Range:** Partition by region, sub-partition by date
- **Range-Range:** Partition by year, sub-partition by month

## Recommended Strategies by Table Type

### Fact Tables
- **Primary Strategy:** Range partitioning by transaction date
- **Sub-partitioning:** Hash or list based on high-cardinality dimensions
- **Partition Size:** 10-50 GB per partition (optimal for manageability)
- **Retention:** Implement ILM policies for automatic compression and archival

### Dimension Tables
- **Small Dimensions (<10M rows):** No partitioning required
- **Large Dimensions (>10M rows):** List or hash partitioning
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions:** Range partitioning by effective_date

### Staging Tables
- **Strategy:** Range or list partitioning matching source system
- **Purpose:** Facilitate efficient truncate/exchange partition operations
- **Retention:** Short-term (1-7 days)

## Partition Key Selection Guidelines

1. **Choose keys that support common query patterns**
   - Analyze WHERE clause predicates
   - Consider JOIN conditions
   - Review ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses

2. **Aim for partition elimination**
   - Ensure queries can prune 80%+ of partitions
   - Monitor partition access patterns

3. **Balance partition count**
   - Too few: Limited parallelism, large partition sizes
   - Too many: Metadata overhead, plan optimization delays
   - Recommended: 12-365 partitions for range-partitioned tables

4. **Consider data growth**
   - Plan for 2-3 years of growth
   - Automate partition creation (interval partitioning)

## Interval Partitioning

**Automatic partition creation for range-partitioned tables**

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id NUMBER,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount NUMBER
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date)
INTERVAL (NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1,'MONTH'))
(
    PARTITION p_initial VALUES LESS THAN (DATE '2024-01-01')
);
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual partition maintenance
- Eliminates "partition not found" errors
- Automatic partition creation on data insertion

## Partitioning Anti-Patterns

1. **Over-partitioning:** >1000 partitions significantly impacts performance
2. **Wrong key selection:** Partitioning on low-cardinality or non-selective columns
3. **Ignoring local indexes:** Missing local indexes on partition keys
4. **No partition pruning:** Queries that scan all partitions
5. **Mixing partitioned and non-partitioned tables:** Inconsistent strategy

## Performance Considerations

### Query Performance
- Enable partition-wise joins for large table joins
- Use local indexes for partition key columns
- Consider global indexes for non-partition key lookups
- Monitor partition elimination with EXPLAIN PLAN

### DML Performance
- Use partition-extended INSERT for direct partition loads
- Leverage EXCHANGE PARTITION for bulk loads
- Enable parallel DML for partition operations
- Consider partition-level statistics gathering

### Maintenance Windows
- Schedule partition maintenance during low-activity periods
- Use ONLINE operations where possible
- Implement incremental statistics gathering
- Monitor partition-level space usage

## Monitoring and Validation

```sql
-- Check partition distribution
SELECT table_name, partition_name, num_rows, blocks
FROM user_tab_partitions
WHERE table_name = 'SALES'
ORDER BY partition_position;

-- Verify partition pruning
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR(NULL, NULL, 'ALLSTATS LAST'));

-- Monitor partition access
SELECT object_name, subobject_name, value
FROM v$segment_statistics
WHERE statistic_name = 'physical reads'
AND object_name = 'SALES';
```

## Next Steps
1. Review existing table access patterns
2. Identify candidate tables for partitioning
3. Design partition strategy per table
4. Implement ILM policies for automated lifecycle management
5. Test partition pruning and performance
6. Deploy and monitor
